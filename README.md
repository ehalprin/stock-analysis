# Green Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

This project was initiated by a request from Steve, whose parents are interested in green investing. Steve, who just graduated with a degree in finance, was concerned that their stock portfolio was not diversified enough, as they were fully invested in DAQO New Energy Corporation, a company that makes silicon wafers for solar panels. Steve requested an analysis of DAQO stock, including volume and rate of return, as well as that information on a few other green energy stocks. This analysis was completed in Excel using Visual Basic Application (VBA) to streamline the analysis process.
